rtb-tclrobotit
==============

This is an experimental repository, which has some code that
implements a robot control language in Finnish (using on Tcl),
that can be used to control robots in "realtimebattle" (see
http://realtimebattle.sourceforge.net/ for realtimebattle and
http://tcl.tk/ for Tcl).  The point is to experiment on how to make
programming educational and fun ;-)

Ideas and things to do (perhaps will never happen):

  - run robot control scripts in safe Tcl interpreter (!)
  - provide a complete support for realtimebattle API
  - write a wrapper GUI tool that can be used to edit a robot and control
    tournaments
  - write some actual, more intelligent robots
  - provide translations of the robot language
  - turn realtimebattle into a racing car simulator (or something else
    completely different)
